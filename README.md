# Passenger Count Application

This is a simple web application that allows you to keep track of the number of passengers and save the count history as well as export it as a CSV file.

## Features

- Increment and decrement passenger count.
- Save passenger count history with timestamps.
- Export the count history as a CSV file.
- Responsive styling for mobile devices.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Use the "+ Increment" button to increase the passenger count and the "- Decrement" button to decrease it.

3. Click the "Save Count" button to save the current count along with a timestamp to the history.

4. The count history will be displayed below the buttons. You can clear the history by clicking the "Clear History" button.

5. To export the count history as a CSV file, click the "Export as CSV" button. The file will be downloaded with the name in the format `passenger-count-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.csv`.

## How it Works

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It maintains a current passenger count, a list of history entries, and uses various functions to update the count and history. The history is displayed on the page and can be saved as a CSV file.
